# üîß Required Manual Setup

This document outlines the manual setup steps required after the automated SDLC implementation due to GitHub App permission limitations.

## üö® Critical Setup Steps

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflows

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è MANUAL ACTION REQUIRED

The automated SDLC implementation has created comprehensive workflow templates in `docs/workflows/examples/`, but these need to be manually copied to `.github/workflows/` due to GitHub App permissions.

**Action Required**:
```bash
# Create workflows directory
mkdir -p .github/workflows

# Copy workflow templates
cp docs/workflows/examples/*.yml .github/workflows/

# Commit and push
git add .github/workflows/
git commit -m "feat: add CI/CD workflows from templates"
git push
```

**Required Workflows**:
- [ ] `ci.yml` - Continuous Integration
- [ ] `cd.yml` - Continuous Deployment  
- [ ] `security-scan.yml` - Security Scanning
- [ ] `dependency-update.yml` - Dependency Updates
