    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9, "3.10", "3.11"]
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -e ".[dev]"
    
    - name: Lint with flake8
      run: flake8 microdiff_matdesign tests
    
    - name: Type check with mypy
      run: mypy microdiff_matdesign
    
    - name: Security check
      run: |
        bandit -r microdiff_matdesign
        safety check
    
    - name: Test with pytest
      run: pytest tests/ --cov=microdiff_matdesign --cov-report=xml
    
    - name: Upload coverage to Codecov
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
      with:
        file: ./coverage.xml
```

### 2. Security Scanning (`.github/workflows/security.yml`)

```yaml
name: Security Scan

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * 1'  # Weekly Monday 2 AM

jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Run CodeQL Analysis
      uses: github/codeql-action/init@v2
      with:
        languages: python
    
    - name: Perform CodeQL Analysis
      uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2
    
    - name: Run Trivy vulnerability scanner
      uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
      with:
        scan-type: 'fs'
        scan-ref: '.'
        format: 'sarif'
        output: 'trivy-results.sarif'
    
    - name: Upload Trivy scan results
      uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2
      with:
        sarif_file: 'trivy-results.sarif'
```

### 3. Dependency Updates (`.github/workflows/dependencies.yml`)

```yaml
name: Update Dependencies

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 3 * * 1'  # Weekly Monday 3 AM
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  update-dependencies:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.10'
    
    - name: Update pip-tools
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip-tools
        pip-compile --upgrade requirements.in
    
    - name: Create Pull Request
      uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v5
      with:
        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        commit-message: 'chore: update dependencies'
        title: 'Automated dependency updates'
        body: |
          Automated dependency updates generated by GitHub Actions.
          
          Please review the changes and ensure all tests pass.
        branch: dependency-updates
```

## Integration Requirements

To integrate these workflows:

1. Create `.github/workflows/` directory in your repository
2. Copy the YAML content above into respective files
3. Configure secrets in GitHub repository settings:
   - `CODECOV_TOKEN` for coverage reporting
4. Enable CodeQL security scanning in repository settings
5. Configure Dependabot for automated dependency updates

## Workflow Features

- **Multi-Python version testing** (3.8-3.11)
- **Comprehensive quality gates** (lint, type-check, security, tests)
- **Security scanning** with CodeQL and Trivy
- **Coverage reporting** to Codecov
- **Automated dependency updates** with safety checks
- **Matrix strategy** for parallel testing

## Rollback Procedures

If workflows fail or cause issues:

1. **Disable workflow**: Go to Actions tab → Select workflow → Disable
2. **Revert PR**: Use GitHub's revert feature on problematic PR
3. **Emergency fix**: Create hotfix branch bypassing some checks
4. **Rollback deployment**: Use previous release tag

## Monitoring and Alerts

Set up notifications for:
- Failed builds on main branch
- Security vulnerability discoveries
- Dependency update failures
- Coverage threshold drops

Configure in repository Settings → Notifications.
