# MicroDiff-MatDesign Project Charter

## Executive Summary

MicroDiff-MatDesign aims to revolutionize materials design by leveraging cutting-edge diffusion models to solve the inverse problem in additive manufacturing: determining optimal process parameters to achieve desired microstructural and mechanical properties.

## Problem Statement

Traditional materials design follows a time-consuming forward approach: engineers select process parameters, manufacture samples, characterize results, and iterate. This approach:

- **Requires extensive experimentation** (months to years per alloy/process combination)
- **Involves significant material waste** and energy consumption
- **Limits exploration** of complex parameter spaces
- **Slows innovation** in advanced manufacturing

## Vision Statement

**"Enable real-time, AI-driven optimization of manufacturing processes to produce materials with precisely tailored properties while minimizing waste and development time."**
